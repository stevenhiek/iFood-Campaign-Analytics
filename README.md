# Brazil’s Hidden Behemoth: iFood Campaign Analytics

## Project Background
iFood is the leading food delivery platform in Brazil, surpassing American counterparts like DoorDash and Uber Eats. Founded in 2011, iFood connects restaurants, couriers, and customers through a seamless app experience, offering on-demand food and grocery delivery while commanding over 80% of Brazil’s market share. 

The company has data on existing customer demographics, marketing campaigns, and purchasing behavior that have been previously underutilized. This project thoroughly analyzes and synthesizes this data in order to uncover critical insights to improve iFood’s marketing campaigns through maintaining customer retention. The analysis is intended to inform strategic decisions made by key stakeholders in the Marketing and Sales department.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
* Customer Segmentation: Evaluation of customer segmentation through Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis, incorporating Gross Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and regression analysis based on demographic attributes.
* Campaign Performance: An analysis of marketing campaign effectiveness, focusing on total customer spend among respondents and Cost per Conversion (CPC) across customer segments.
* Purchasing Behavior: A review of purchasing behavior patterns across key customer segments, highlighting preferences by product offering, product category, purchase channel, and discount affinity.

## Data Structure & Initial Checks
The dataset includes customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and information from 5 marketing campaigns. It has 2205 total rows with each row corresponding to a unique customer that was randomly selected. There were 184 duplicate rows that were removed, resulting in 2021 unique customer rows within the data. The raw data, prior to cleaning, can be found [here](https://github.com/stevenhiek/iFood-Campaign-Analytics/tree/main/Data).

Prior to beginning the analysis, a variety of checks were conducted for quality control and familiarization with the dataset. The data cleaning and data quality checks can be found in the worksheets, *Data Cleaning* and *Data Quality Checks*, [here](https://github.com/stevenhiek/iFood-Campaign-Analytics/tree/main/Analysis).
